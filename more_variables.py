#We have to buy 4 apples, $0.5 per one apple
item = "Apples"
price = 0.5
quantity = 4

#calculate the total price
total = price * quantity

print("The total price of {quantity} 4 apple was ${total}.")


#Without knowing any of the values stored in the variables, how do you know the line games_remaining = total_season_games - games_played must be correct?
#total_season_games = the total number of games
#games_played = the number of games already played
#To find the number of games remaining you have to subtract the number of games played from the total
